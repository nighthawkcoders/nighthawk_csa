# Data Ops with Spring/Java

### Overview
This lab and future labs can/should be strung together.

1. Pull code and Demo.
2. Key elements (Data, Controller, Data Structure, Sort)
   -- Activity, reverse order of sort --
3. Object, toString, changing Key (static)
   -- Add data to a Class --
4. Look at Checkboxes and Radio Buttons.
   -- Activity, add sound to animal sort key (can you get it to work?) --

### Key Topics
* @Controller (My code)
* Static Variables
* Enums
### Other Topics
* Inheritance
* Abstract Class (My code)

### Mini-lab Ideas
1. Build  section into your Scrum Team project or individual section for execution.
2. Build abstract Class and have multiple derivative classes (extend) with Override on method(s).
3. Have default data that loads and displays on Web page
4. Interact with data on Web to Filter result using Check Box and Radio Controls
5. Prepare or think ahead to Sort lab.

### Mini-lab binary point criteria
* Make your own Data/Class and initialize it.   See how far you can go  to get things to work.  Make adaptations as you see fit.
* Use of toString()
* Use of a Data Structure to hold Objects of your Class or Abstract class.
* Web UI and visuals to interact with data
* Check Boxes
* Radio Buttons
* Console testers of component parts of system.
