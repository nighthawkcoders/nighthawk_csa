                    <div class="mb-1 text-muted"><strong>Location is no longer a barrier. </strong>No matter where you live, we can find the perfect tutor for your child.
                        Once you've found that tutor, you can stick with them, wherever you are
                        and wherever they are. There's no risk of tutoring being interrupted by
                        bad-weather, accidents or vacations (unless you want it to be).</div>
                    <br>

                    <div class="mb-1 text-muted"><strong>Online tutoring can make your life easier.</strong> We know your schedules are hectic and finding an hour or two in the week
                        to fit tutoring in can be a real challenge. Moving online opens up more
                        time slots and means tutoring can happen from anywhere with a decent internet
                        connection. You also don't have to worry about cleaning the house before
                        the tutor comes around!.</div>
                    <br>

                    <div class="mb-1 text-muted"> <strong>Remember everything.</strong> Every online tutoring session with TutorVue is recorded, so the student
                        can review it later. This helps them retain information and refresh their
                        memory before that vital exam. This is especially valuable for older students
                        studying STEM subjects and is one of the major reasons for choosing online
                        tutoring over offline tutoring.*</div>

                        They moved seamlessly into distance learning as soon as the pandemic started.
                        Our tutor Karen is amazing. She's always so positive with our son and
                        she has amazing patience. We love that we can connect with her directly
                        about what we'd like her to work on with him. She's super flexible when

                        a confidence in math that she never had before thanks to her wonderful

                        the conviennent online sessions. The online sessions are wonderful because
